So what I wanna do today is ju st spend a little time going over the logistics \\nof the class, and then we'll start to  talk a bit about machine learning.  \\nBy way of introduction, my name's  Andrew Ng and I'll be instru ctor for this class. And so \\nI personally work in machine learning, and I' ve worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\nI actually think that machine learning is th e most exciting field of all the computer \\nsciences. So I'm actually always excited about  teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\nthink that machine learning is not only the most exciting thin g in computer science, but \\nthe most exciting thing in all of human e ndeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\nI also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\nrelated to the machine learni ng and all aspects of machin e learning.

I feel that machine learning grew out of  early work in AI, early work in artificial \\nintelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been viewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\nthat there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.\", metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture01 (1).pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content=\"that there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.  \\nFor example, if you want to get a computer to read handwritten characters, to read sort of \\nhandwritten digits, that actual ly turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of \\nsoftware to take this input, an image of some thing that I wrote and to  figure out just what \\nit is, to translate my cursive handwriting into — to extract the characters I wrote out in \\nlonghand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\nturns out to be extremely difficult to sit dow n and write a program to  fly a helicopter.  \\nBut in contrast, if you want to do things like to get software to fl y a helicopter or have \\nsoftware recognize handwritten digits, one very  successful approach is to use a learning \\nalgorithm and have a computer learn by its elf how to, say, recognize your handwriting.\", metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture01 (1).pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content=\"algorithm and have a computer learn by its elf how to, say, recognize your handwriting. \\nAnd in fact, handwritten digit recognition, this is pretty much the only approach that \\nworks well. It uses applications that are hard to program by hand.  \\nLearning algorithms has also made I guess sign ificant inroads in what's sometimes called \\ndatabase mining. So, for example, with the growth of IT and computers, increasingly \\nmany hospitals are keeping around medical reco rds of what sort of patients, what \\nproblems they had, what their prognoses was,  what the outcome was. And taking all of \\nthese medical records, which started to be digitized only about maybe 15 years, applying \\nlearning algorithms to them can turn raw medi cal records into what I might loosely call \\nmedical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical practice and even start to \\nalter medical practice as a result of me dical knowledge that's derived by applying\", metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture01 (1).pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content=\"alter medical practice as a result of me dical knowledge that's derived by applying \\nlearning algorithms to the sorts of medical r ecords that hospitals have just been building \\nover the last 15, 20 years in an electronic format.  \\nTurns out that most of you probably use learning algorithms — I don't know — I think \\nhalf a dozen times a day or maybe a dozen  times a day or more, and often without \\nknowing it. So, for example, every time you se nd mail via the US Postal System, turns \\nout there's an algorithm that tries to automa tically read the zip code you wrote on your \\nenvelope, and that's done by a learning al gorithm.

So \\nevery time you write a check, there's anot her learning algorithm that you're probably \\nusing without even being aware of it.  \\nIf you use a credit card, or I know at least one phone compan y was doing this, and lots of \\ncompanies like eBay as well that do electr onic transactions, there's a good chance that \\nthere's a learning algorithm in the backgr ound trying to figure out if, say, your credit \\ncard's been stolen or if someone's engaging in a fraudulent transaction.  \\nIf you use a website like Amazon or Netflix that will often recommend books for you to \\nbuy or movies for you to rent or whatever , these are other examples of learning\", metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture01 (1).pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content=\"buy or movies for you to rent or whatever , these are other examples of learning \\nalgorithms that have learned what sorts of th ings you like to buy or what sorts of movies \\nyou like to watch and can therefore give  customized recommendations to you.  \\nJust about a week ago, I had my car serviced, and even there, my car mechanic was trying \\nto explain to me some learning algorithm in th e innards of my car th at's sort of doing its \\nbest to optimize my driving performan ce for fuel efficiency or something.  \\nSo, see, most of us use learning algorithms half a dozen, a dozen, maybe dozens of times \\nwithout even knowing it.  \\nAnd of course, learning algorithms are also  doing things like giving us a growing \\nunderstanding of the human genome.

At some of the discussion sections, we'll actually \\ngo over some of the prerequisites, sort of as  a refresher course under prerequisite class. \\nI'll say a bit more about that later as well.  \\nLastly, I also assume familiarity with basi c linear algebra.

We'll go over it in \\nthe review sections.  \\nSo there are a couple more logisti cal things I should deal with in  this class. One is that, as \\nmost of you know, CS229 is a televised cla ss.

We're gonna talk about four major topics in this class, the first \\nof which is supervised learning. So le t me give you an example of that.  \\nSo suppose you collect a data set of housing prices.

Let's say I have a hou se that's this size in square footage, and \\nI want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for.

And \\nthen we want the algorithm to learn the a ssociation between the inputs and the outputs \\nand to sort of give us more of the right answers, okay?  \\nIt turns out this specific exam ple that I drew here is an example of something called a \\nregression problem.

So, for example, in  the supervised learning cancer prediction \\nproblem, you have a patient come in, you predict that the cancer is malignant or benign. \\nAnd then based on your prediction, maybe the pa tient lives or dies, and then that's it, \\nright? So you make a decision and then there's a consequence. You either got it right or \\nwrong. In reinforcement learning problems, you are usually asked to make a sequence of \\ndecisions over time.  \\nSo, for example, this is something that my students and I work on.

What we have to think about is imagine you\\'re \\ntrying to train a dog. So every time y our dog does something good, you say, \"Good dog,\" \\nand you reward the dog. Every time your dog does something bad, you go, \"Bad dog,\" right?

And when we’re talking about linear regression or linear l east squares, we use \\nthis to denote the predicted value of “by my hypothesis H” on the input XI. And my \\nhypothesis was franchised by the vector of gram s as theta and so we said that this was \\nequal to some from theta J, si J, and more  theta transpose X. And we had the convention \\nthat X subscript Z is equal to one so this accounts for the intercept term in our linear regression model.

One of the f eatures was the size of the houses in square \\nfeet, so the living area of the house, and the other feature was the number of bedrooms in \\nthe house. In general, we apply a machine- learning algorithm to some problem that you \\ncare about. The choice of the features will very much be up to you, right? And the way \\nyou choose your features to give the learning algorithm will often have a large impact on \\nhow it actually does. So just for example, the choice we made last time was X1 equal this \\nsize, and let’s leave this idea of the feature of the number of bedrooms for now, let’s say \\nwe don’t have data that tells us how many bedrooms are in these houses. One thing you', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='could do is actually define – oh, let’s draw this out. And s o, right?

I think this would be the predicted value for – this would \\nbe the value of then my hypothesis output s in locally weighted regression. Okay?  \\nSo we’re gonna fall one up. Let me go ahead and formalize that. In locally weighted \\nregression, we’re going to fit theta to minimi ze sum over I to minimize that where these \\nterms W superscript I are called weights. Th ere are many possible choice for ways, I’m \\njust gonna write one down. So this E’s and mi nus, XI minus X squared over two. So let’s \\nlook at what these weights really are, right ? So notice that – suppose you have a training \\nexample XI. So that XI is very close to X. So this is small, right? Then if XI minus X is \\nsmall, so if XI minus X is close to zero, th en this is E’s to the minus zero and E to the \\nzero is one. So if XI is close to X, then WI will be close to one. In other words, the', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='zero is one. So if XI is close to X, then WI will be close to one. In other words, the \\nweight associated with the, I training exampl e be close to one if XI and X are close to \\neach other. Conversely if XI minus X is large then – I don’t know, what would WI be?  \\nStudent: Zero.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) :Zero, right. Close to zero. Right. So if XI is very far from X \\nthen this is E to the minus of some large number and E to the minus some large number will be close to zero. Okay? So the picture is, if I’m quarrying at a certain point X, shown on the X axis, and if my data set, say, l ook like that, then I’m going to give the points \\nclose to this a large weight and give the points far away a small weight. So for the points \\nthat are far away, WI will be close to zero. A nd so as if for the points that are far away, \\nthey will not contribute much at all to this  summation, right? So I th ink this is sum over I', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='they will not contribute much at all to this  summation, right? So I th ink this is sum over I \\nof one times this quadratic term for points by points plus zero times this quadratic term \\nfor faraway points. And so the effect of usi ng this weighting is that locally weighted \\nlinear regression fits a set of parameters thet a, paying much more a ttention to fitting the \\npoints close by accurately. Whereas ignoring the contribution from faraway points. \\nOkay? Yeah?  \\nStudent: Your Y is exponentially [inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) :Yeah. Let’s see. So it turns out  there are many other weighting \\nfunctions you can use. It turns out that th ere are definitely different communities of \\nresearchers that tend to choose different c hoices by default. There is somewhat of a \\nliterature on debating what point – exactly what function to us e.

Okay? But this actually \\nhas absolutely nothing to  do with Gaussian distribution. So this is not that a problem with \\nXI is Gaussian or whatever. This is no su ch interpretation.

Okay? And so training ex amples that are really far away get a very \\nsmall weight.  \\nOne last small generalization to this is that  normally there’s one other parameter to this \\nalgorithm, which I’ll denote as tow. Again, this  looks suspiciously lik e the variants of a \\nGaussian, but this is not a Gaussian. This  is a convenient form or function.

This \\nparameter tow is called the bandwidth paramete r and informally it controls how fast the \\nweights fall of with distance. Okay? So just  copy my diagram from the other side, I \\nguess. So if tow is very small, if that’s  a query X, then you end up choosing a fairly \\nnarrow Gaussian – excuse me, a fairly narrow be ll shape, so that the weights of the points \\nare far away fall off rapidly.

Remember the outline I had, I guess, at \\nthe beginning of this lecture. What I want to do now is talk about a probabilistic interpretation of linear regres sion, all right? And in partic ular of the – it’ll be this \\nprobabilistic interpretati on that let’s us move on to talk  about logistic regression, which \\nwill be our first classification algorithm. So le t’s put aside locally weighted regression for \\nnow. We’ll just talk about ordinary unwei ghted linear regression. Let’s ask the question \\nof why least squares, right?

So in that se nse, assumptions we make are never “absolutely true,” but \\nfor practical purposes this is a accurate enough assumption that  it’ll be useful to make. \\nOkay? I think in a week or two, we’ll actually come back to selected more about the \\nassumptions we make and when they help our  learning algorithms a nd when they hurt our \\nlearning algorithms. We’ll say a bit more about  it when we talk about generative and \\ndiscriminative learning algorithms, like, in a week or two. Okay?  \\nSo let’s point out one bit of notation, which is that when I wrote this down I actually \\nwrote P of YI given XI and then semicolon theta and I’m going to us e this notation when \\nwe are not thinking of theta as a random vari able. So in statistics, though, sometimes it’s \\ncalled the frequentist’s point of view, where you think of there as being some, sort of, \\ntrue value of theta that’s out there that’s generating the data say, but we don’t know what', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='true value of theta that’s out there that’s generating the data say, but we don’t know what \\ntheta is, but theta is not a ra ndom vehicle, right? So it’s not like there’s some random \\nvalue of theta out there. It’s that theta is – th ere’s some true value of theta out there. It’s \\njust that we don’t know what the true value of theta is. So if theta is not a random \\nvariable, then I’m going to avoid writing P of  YI given XI comma theta, because this \\nwould mean that probably of YI conditio ned on X and theta and you can only condition \\non random variables. So at this part of the class where we’re taking sort of frequentist’s \\nviewpoint rather than the Dasi an viewpoint, in this part of  class we’re thinking of theta \\nnot as a random variable, but just as so mething we’re trying to estimate and use the \\nsemicolon notation. So the way to read this is this is the probability  of YI given XI and \\nparameterized by theta. Okay? So you read the semicolon as parameterized by. And in', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='parameterized by theta. Okay? So you read the semicolon as parameterized by. And in \\nthe same way here, I’ll say YI given XI pa rameterized by theta is distributed Gaussian \\nwith that.  \\nAll right. So we’re gonna make  one more assumption. Let’s assume that the error terms \\nare IID, okay? Which stands for Independently  and Identically Distributed. So it’s going \\nto assume that the error terms are indepe ndent of each other, right? The identically \\ndistributed part just means that I’m a ssuming the outcome for the same Gaussian \\ndistribution or the same varian ce, but the more important part  of is this is that I’m \\nassuming that the epsilon I’s are independent of  each other. Now, let’s talk about how to \\nfit a model. The probability of Y given X parameterized by theta – I’m actually going to give this another name. I’m going to write th is down and we’ll call this the lik elihood of \\ntheta as the probability of Y given X paramete rized by theta. And so this is going to be', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='theta as the probability of Y given X paramete rized by theta. And so this is going to be \\nthe product over my training set like that. Which is, in turn, going to be a product of those \\nGaussian densities that I wrot e down just now, right?

Given X and prioritized \\nby theta. To test the likeli hood and probability are often confused. So the likelihood of \\ntheta is the same thing as the probability of  the data you saw. So likely and probably are, \\nsort of, the same thing. Except that when  I use the term likelihood I’m trying to \\nemphasize that I’m taking this thing and view ing it as a function of  theta.

Well, one thing you \\ncould do is take linear regre ssion, as we’ve described it so far, and apply it to this \\nproblem, right?

So you apply linear regr essions to this data set and \\nyou get a reasonable fit and you can then maybe  take your linear regr ession hypothesis to \\nthis straight line and thres hold it at 0.5.

Apply linear  regression to classi fication problems and \\nsometimes it’ll work okay, but in general it’s actually a pretty bad idea to apply linear \\nregression to classification problems like thes e and here’s why. Let’s say I change my \\ntraining set by giving you just one more tr aining example all the way up there, right? \\nImagine if given this training set is actually  still entirely obvious  what the relationship \\nbetween X and Y is, right?

The point of this is just that it could be a really bad idea to apply linear \\nregression to classification algorithm. Someti mes it work fine, but usually I wouldn’t do \\nit. So a couple of problems with this. One is that, well – so what do you want to do for \\nclassification? If you know the value of Y lie s between zero and one then to kind of fix \\nthis problem let’s just start by changing the form of our hypothesis so that my hypothesis \\nalways lies in the unit interval between zero a nd one. Okay? So if I know Y is either zero \\nor one then let’s at least not have my hypothe sis predict values much  larger than one and \\nmuch smaller than zero. And so I’m going to – instead of choosing a linear function for \\nmy hypothesis I’m going to choose something s lightly different. And, in particular, I’m \\ngoing to choose this function, H subscript th eta of X is going to equal to G of theta', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='going to choose this function, H subscript th eta of X is going to equal to G of theta \\ntranspose X where G is going to be this func tion and so this becomes more than one plus \\ntheta X of theta transpose X.

So when you have your  horizontal axis I’m \\ngoing to plot Z and so G of Z will look like this. Okay? I didn’t draw that very well. \\nOkay. So G of Z tends towards zero as Z becomes very small and G of Z will ascend towards one as Z becomes large and it crosses the vertical axis at 0.5. So this is what \\nsigmoid function, also called the logi stic function of. Yeah? Question?  \\nStudent: What sort of sigmoid in other step five?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) :Say that again.  \\nStudent: Why we cannot chose this at five for so me reason, like, that’s better binary.', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='Instructor (Andrew Ng) :Yeah. Let me come back to that later. So it turns out that Y – \\nwhere did I get this function fr om, right? I just wrote down th is function. It actually turns \\nout that there are two reasons for using this  function that we’ll come to. One is – we \\ntalked about generalized linear m odels. We’ll see that this falls out naturally as part of the \\nbroader class of models. And another reason th at we’ll talk about ne xt week, it turns out \\nthere are a couple of, I think, ve ry beautiful reasons for why we choose logistic functions. \\nWe’ll see that in a little bit. But for now let me just define it  and just take my word for it \\nfor now that this is a reasonable choice. Okay? But notice now th at my – the values \\noutput by my hypothesis will always be between  zero and one. Furthermore, just like we \\ndid for linear regression, I’m going to e ndow the outputs and my hypothesis with a', metadata={'source': '../transcript\\\\MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='did for linear regression, I’m going to e ndow the outputs and my hypothesis with a \\nprobabilistic interpretati on, right?

So in other words I’m going to imagin e that my hypothesis is outputting all these \\nnumbers that lie between zero and one. I’m going to think of my hypothesis as trying to \\nestimate the probability that Y is equal to one . Okay? And because Y has to be either zero \\nor one then the probability of Y equals zero is  going to be that. All right? So more simply \\nit turns out – actually, take th ese two equations and write them more compactly. Write P \\nof Y given X parameterized by theta. This is going to be H subscript theta of X to the \\npower of Y times one minus H of X to  the power of one minus Y.

So this \\nis a compact way of writing both of these equatio ns to gather them to one line. So let’s \\nhope our parameter fitting, right?

It turns out that very often – ju st when you work with th e derivations, it turns \\nout that it is often much easier to maximize the log of the likelihood rather than maximize \\nthe likelihood. So the log likelihood L of theta is just log of capital L. This will, therefore, \\nbe sum of this. Okay?

So can actually use exactly the same algorithm to \\nmaximize the log likelihood. And you remember, that algorithm was just repeatedly take \\nthe value of theta and you repla ce it with the previous value of theta plus a learning rate \\nalpha times the gradient of the cos functi on.

It turns out  that if you actually compute this partial \\nderivative – so you take this formula, this L of theta, which is – oh, got that wrong too. If \\nyou take this lower case l theta,  if you take the log likelihood of  theta, and if you take it’s \\npartial derivative with respect to theta I you find that this is  equal to – let’s see.

The technical term is that it en joys a property called [i naudible] conversions. \\nDon’t know [inaudible] what that means, but  just stated informally, it means that \\n[inaudible] every iteration of Newton’s Method will double the number of significant \\ndigits that your solution is accurate t o.

And just to complete the rest of this, T of Y is equal to \\nY, and B of Y is equal to one, okay.  \\nSo just to recap what we’ve done, we’ve come  up with a certain choice of functions A, T \\nand B, so then my formula for the exponen tial family distribution now becomes exactly \\nthe formula for the distributions, or for the probability mass function of the [inaudible] \\ndistribution.
